This project is my ongoing **Own reseach** for an **algorithmic trading stack** that integrates classical **ML4T workflows** with advanced **LÃ©vy-process modeling**. The core stack spans:

- **Signal layer** (market + alternative data ingestion)  
- **LÃ©vy-based modeling** (capturing fat-tails, jumps, stochastic volatility)  
- **Risk controls** (VaR / Expected Shortfall overlays)  
- **Calibration checks** (stable parameter estimation routines)  
- **Milestone tracking** (stress testing, reproducibility, logging)  

My current focus is on **stabilizing parameter estimation**, **expanding stress tests**, and **tightening logging** for reproducible runs in both **R and Python**.

## ðŸ”¹ Enhancing ML4T Workflow with LÃ©vy Processes  

The **standard ML4T workflow** (Figure 1.1) connects **data sources**, **feature engineering**, **machine learning models**, and **portfolio optimization** into an end-to-end trading loop.  

> In my project, I enhance this by integrating **LÃ©vy processes** into the **factor modeling and prediction stages**, where jump-diffusions and heavy-tailed distributions provide more robust modeling of extreme market moves compared to Gaussian assumptions.

## ðŸ”¹ Research-to-Execution Flow  

Similarly, the **alpha factor research process** (Figure 1.2) outlines the pipeline from predictive data â†’ alpha design â†’ portfolio execution.  

In my lab implementation (Apple AT system), Iâ€™ve developed a **predictive model that extracts signals** from both **market** and **alternative data**, feeding into **systematic trading strategies** coded in Python.

## ðŸ”¹ Use Cases of ML for Trading  

Machine learning is uniquely positioned to **extract tradable signals** across asset classes and horizons. Its flexibility lies in quantifiable goals and digital data streams, making it applicable throughout the trading lifecycle.  

Key use cases include:  

- **Data Mining** â†’ identify patterns, extract features, and generate insights  
- **Supervised Learning** â†’ generate risk factors (alphas) and create trade ideas  
- **Signal Aggregation** â†’ combine individual alphas into robust strategies  
- **Asset Allocation** â†’ optimize based on risk profiles learned by algorithms  
- **Testing & Evaluation** â†’ validate strategies, stress test with synthetic data  
- **Reinforcement Learning** â†’ interactive refinement of trading strategies
