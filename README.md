# GonsalgeAlmeida: Statistician/Financial Modeler/ Data Scientist

The repository contains my website's backend, which you can find  [here](https://gonsalgealmeida.github.io/).

On the site, you can read about me, view or download my resume, see a selected list of projects I have done in TDI fellow, or see a list of my main projects from my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Ph.D. in Statistics explorations. Also, I will add some projects applying ML models to solve real-world problems.
The foundation of this site is a Jekyll theme called 'Hydejack.' At the request of the creators, I build locally and then push the site to GitHub; many of the created documents are not in this repository.
